### Why I Built This
Honestly, I wanted a portfolio site that looks good, loads quickly, and is easy to manage. I built this in just one day and decided to make it public so others can benefit too.  

### How I Built This 
This site is powered by **Next.js**, styled with **Tailwind CSS**, animated using **Framer Motion**, and includes **React Icons** for a polished look.  

### Get Started

   ```npm

   ```
2. Install Dependencies:
  ```npm

   ```
3. Run the development server:
